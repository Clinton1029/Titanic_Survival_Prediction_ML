## üéØ Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting Titanic passenger survival. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and more.

**Dataset**: Titanic passenger data (887 samples, 8 features) from Stanford University
**Objective**: Binary classification (Survived vs Not Survived)
**Best Model Accuracy**: 80.3% (Decision Tree)

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comprehensive EDA** with detailed visualizations and statistical analysis
- **Advanced Feature Engineering** creating domain-specific features
- **Multiple ML Algorithms** with hyperparameter tuning
- **Cross-Validation & Model Evaluation** with multiple metrics
- **Interactive Sample Testing** for model validation
- **Professional Reporting** with business insights
